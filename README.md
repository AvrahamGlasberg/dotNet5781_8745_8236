Course in WPF at JCT, Avraham &amp; Itamar
# For compiling:
After building the project, first insert the two files from the "dll for project" folder into the bin->debug folder,&#x0a; 
**then** run the "SaveDataProject" once. if the console did not write any error messages, you can run the "PL" project and use the application.
## Notice:
The initial data in the project does **not** have any line's travels at all. to see them in the simultor window you must add "new trip" to lines manually.
# Manager access (also function as user):
**Name:** Avraham, **Password:** 1. (should appear as defult when trying to log-in), or register new Administer/User.
### About the simulator:
Notice that the 'rate' of the simulator is how fast the simulation runs compare to real-time. (so for example, rate = 60 means that in every real second, will pass a minute in the simulation)
Also, notice that the electronic bored is updated only when the line is arriving at one of its stations, so if one of the lines seem to be 'stuck' check (and possibly change) the time the line is taking between the stations.
