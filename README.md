# For compiling:
After building the project, first insert the two files from the "dll for project" folder into the bin->debug folder,&#x0a; 
**then** run the "SaveDataProject" once. if the console did not write any error messages, you can run the "PL" project and use the application.
## Notice:
The initial data in the project does **not** have any line's travels at all. to see them in the simultor window you must add "new trip" to lines manually.
# Manager access (also function as user):
